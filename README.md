This Project simulates three slot machines that follow specific rules:

    Each machine costs 1 quarter to play
    The first machine pays 25 quarters every 35th time it is played.
    The second machine pays 75 quarters every 100th time it is played.
    The third pays 5 quarters every 8th time it is played

The program assumes that the user will use the machines in the following order:

    machine 1
    machine 2
    machine 3
    (repeat)

Following these rules, the user can input how many quarters they would like to gamble and the program will display information such as which machine was used, what number was rolled, how many times a machine has been used and how many quarters the user has left. 

This project demonstrates the ability to define several methods in order to create a better organized final outcome.

Below is an example of the code running:

    Enter the number of quarters you have: 
    
    6
    Machine 1 was used.
    You rolled: 758
    Machine 1 has been used 1 times.
    You have played 1 times.
    You now have 5 quarter(s)
    
    Machine 2 was used.
    You rolled: 666
    Machine 2 has been used 1 times.
    You have played 2 times.
    You now have 4 quarter(s)
    
    Machine 3 was used.
    You rolled: 363
    Machine 3 has been used 1 times.
    You have played 3 times.
    You now have 3 quarter(s)
    
    Machine 1 was used.
    You rolled: 955
    Machine 1 has been used 2 times.
    You have played 4 times.
    You now have 2 quarter(s)
    
    Machine 2 was used.
    You rolled: 958
    Machine 2 has been used 2 times.
    You have played 5 times.
    You now have 1 quarter(s)
    
    Machine 3 was used.
    You rolled: 561
    Machine 3 has been used 2 times.
    You have played 6 times.
    You now have 0 quarter(s)
    
    In total, you played 6 times.
